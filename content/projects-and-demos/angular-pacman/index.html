                    <p>
                        The main subject of this project was angularJS. It seemed like one of the basics for a web-dev person (not that I am one), so I decided to jump into the subject. After going through an excellent tutorial on Udemy - taught by the awesome <a href="http://www.loonycorn.com/#/">Loony Corn</a> - I felt ready to tackle my own project. And, as the topic of this post may suggest, I decided to create a primitive Pacman game.  So without further ado, here it is~
                    </p>
                    <div ng-app="pacman" ng-controller="gameController">
                        <div class="stateDisplay">
                            Score: {{gameState.score}}
                            Lives: {{gameState.numLives}}
                        </div>
                        <maze> 
                            <cell grid-index="{{loc}}" ng-repeat="(loc, val) in GRID"></cell>
                            <pacman-agent></pacman-agent>
                            <ghost-agent name="blinky"></ghost-agent>
                            <ghost-agent name="pinky"></ghost-agent>
                            <ghost-agent name="inky"></ghost-agent>
                            <ghost-agent name="clyde"></ghost-agent>
                        </maze>
                    </div>
                    A few implementation notes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You get 10 lives, but ya, the ghosts are on steroids; particularly Blinky (the red one). All of them use varying degrees of A* search to find the optimal moves they should make to catch Pacman at every tiny time-inteval. By <em>varying degrees,</em> I mean they're programmed to make stupid choices at different time-intervals as well.</li>
                        <li>The maze was created with your typical DFS. Then, to make the game playable, I randomly took away some dead ends. Though, I guess that still leaves you with a heck of a difficult maze.</li>
                        <li>Heaps and Sets from Google's Closure Library were used to implement the above algorithms. First time using the library, uber-impressed by it.</li>
                        <li>AngularJS was really what let me treat the agents (Pacman, Blinky, Inky, Pinky, Clyde) and even the walls and pellets, as <em>objects</em>. Source code available <a href="https://github.com/kenk42292/angular-pacman">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
